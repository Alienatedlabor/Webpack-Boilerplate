# Webpack-Boilerplate
Just a boilerplate so I don't have to make this over and over. Same as the traversy webpack crash course repo except instead of the serve thing I put a src --watch in there. I don't know how to do both, otherwise I would? I also ran the audit so maybe it's not the same, not sure what the audit changed.
